# vectorbeam-eliminator
Digital to analog vector monitor adapter for B&amp;W Vectorbeam/Cinematronics arcade

This board is described and demonstrated in this video:

It allows using an "Atari"-compatible arcade analog vector monitor with a CCPU arcade logic board.

It is highly recommended that the circuit initial check is done using an oscilloscope in X-Y mode first,
at least for the offset tuning.

A misbehaving CCPU board can output bad vector data that can damage the vector monitor (and its own digital monitor too)!
Make sure the logic board at least is executing correctly or use an oscilloscope as XY display to stay on the safe side.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
